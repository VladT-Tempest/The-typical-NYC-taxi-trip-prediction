# The-typical-NYC-taxi-trip-prediction
practicing EDA with PANDAS and ML with Sklearn

In this practice I am going to use dataframes from NYC, Taxi & Limousine Commision: https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.

## TLC Trip Record Data
Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). The trip data was not created by the TLC, and TLC makes no representations as to the accuracy of these data.

**Note:** On 05/2022 the trip record files were stored in PARQUET format and include 17 more columns.
